=============

I use a lot of quantified self tracking tools. For example, I use Toggl.com to track the time I spend on work things, Moves.app to track where I've been, fitbit to track my steps, and a manual log to track the tv & movies I watch.

Unfortunately, these streams of data often live in proprietary data silos; companies want me to experience my data on their websites, using their canned reports and graphs.

I believe more interesting questions can be asked if you take some of these data streams and merge them together... "What genre of movies do I tend to watch before having a week of epic productivity?" "How many steps do I tend to take, the days after I sleep less than 7 hours?"

My current approach has been to push this data onto my google calendar. Putting things on a timeline seems to be the logical (only?) way to normalize my data streams. Google calendar is fine for getting a sense of how my days have gone, but the result is a fairly static representation that hasn't been especially informative for self experimentation.
